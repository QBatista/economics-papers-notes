## Key points

- The boundaries of economic development are often set by powerful social and economic interests promoting the technological status quo.

- While technological progress during the Industrial Revolution was characterized by the simplification of tasks, the idea of capital-skill complementarity has emerged with the Computer Revolution.

- Capital-complementarity has led to a hollowing out of middle-income routine jobs.

- Technological progress has two competing effects on unemployment. First, there is a destruction effect arising from substituting labor for technology, requiring a reallocation of labor supply. Second, the increase in productivity in the industry leads to new firm entries, and therefore, higher employment.

- Many tasks that previously were considered as not susceptible to computerization, such as driving a car, have since then been shown to be susceptible.

- The paper identifies 3 types of labor inputs that are currently less susceptible to computerization: complex perception and manipulation (for example, requiring the manipulation of irregular objects), creative intelligence tasks, and social intelligence tasks.

- The paper uses subjective labels for obtaining various variables to measure the automatability of occupations and then uses a probabilistic classifier.

- A table containing the probability of computerization by occupation is available in the appendix.
