## Key points

- Randomization makes the expectation of the error term in the mean difference between the control and treatment group zero. However, in a given trial, this error term will generally not be zero. Perfect control and control in expectation are not the same things.

- To get unbiasedness, the treatment must not be correlated with other causes. Things such as the impact of awareness of the treatment effect must be taken into account.

- The trial sample may not be representative of the entire population. If correctly constructed, RCTs only give an unbiased estimate of the ATE in the trial sample. A justification is needed to extrapolate to other groups.

- RCTs are useful when we don't have good prior knowledge about how to control. It is generally inferior to good control.

- Balancing covariates between the control and treatment groups becomes harder as the number of covariates increases (curse of dimensionality).

- Testing for differences in covariate means between the treatment group and the control group after randomization is testing a hypothesis that is true by construction. Therefore, a rejection must be a false positive.

- RCTs can only identify differences in means; a statistic that is sometimes ill-behaved. Additional assumptions are needed to study other quantities of interest.

- Fisher-Berhens problem: when two samples have different variances, the usual t statistic does not have a t distribution. Without adjustments, this can lead to spurious significance issues.

- When the distribution of treatment effects is not symmetric, spurious significance often occurs because standard t-tests break down in distributions with enough skewness.

- Successful replication is never sufficient to extrapolate the result of an RCT (Russell's chicken example, 1912). Anecdotal causality is not generalizability. Support factors are needed for the treatment to work. It is crucial to understand why the treatment works.

- Scaling up from the sample to the population will not go through if the outcomes of individuals or groups of individuals change the behavior of others.

- RCTs can be combined with theory to make out-of-sample predictions, balancing the often formidable assumptions necessary in structural estimation with an atheoretic component.

- Effects at scale are generally different than in the trial because of general equilibrium effects. Assuming that the aggregate looks like the individual should be justified.

- ATEs cannot be used for inference at the individual level without further assumptions. Averages are not necessarily useful for individuals.

- The binary concept of external validity is too simplistic. One must consider how a set of support factors provide a channel for causality, and how those affect its magnitude.
